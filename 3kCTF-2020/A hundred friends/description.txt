A hundred friends
=================

Bob wanted to send a secret to all of his friends. But he heard that this is insecure if he has more than two friends, so he decided to modify the secret beforehand.

A part of the source code Bob used was leaked:

	key = RSA.generate(1024)
        pad = random.randint(1, 2**UPPER_BOUND)
        exp = random.randint(1, 3)
        c = pow(m**exp + pad, 3, key.n)
